# Introduction

Our cities are a complicated mess of failed policies and market failures that have not been solved efficiently. I am a researcher of spatial & transport economics. In this collaborative series, I develop a systematic guide on how to solve the biggest challenges cities face. 

## The challenge

I identify 3 main challenges cities face. I plan to expand this list to include other challenges like the environment and equity later, but for now these are the main problems:
- Urban sprawl
- The housing crisis
- Excessive car use 

It turns out, how we go about these issues in basically any country is backwards. This is often due to the fact that the best solutions are usually not the ones that are politically the easiest to convince powerful actors or voters to implement. 

## The goal

My research perspective is economic (I believe other fields are just as important though). When judging a policy from this perspective, I focus on two goals: Efficiency and equity.

**Efficient** is a term to describe getting as much as possible out of the least possible. Sustainable adds a long term focus to it. This includes (but is not limited to) the environment.

**Equity** is about how solutions should not make certain groups disadvantaged. If all the wealth created only help a few, it is hardly a measure of wellbeing for a country.

The goal is *to create the most **efficient** cities without compromising **equity***.

Many people will have you believe that there is purely a trade off between efficiency and equity, but this is not true. Mostly this argument is used to argue against progressive income taxation, in which case it is true that there is some efficiency loss from income taxes. But there is a long list of policies where efficiency increases also can mean equity improvements.

## The plan
### Education
I believe the first step in political change is education. I hope for a future where policy is based on research. That is because, research forms a consensus that is our best guess at the best solution. If new research shows an even better solution it would then be taken up politically and judged scientifically.

This requires voters to be educated about what solutions will be beneficial for us all. The more educated voters are, the better choices politicians will make.

In this day and age, conflicting interests and misinformation is rampant on the internet, so my goal is to break through that with a science-based approach. Social science is a complicated topic, but scientific consensus still represents our best guess.

I hope to inspire my readers and give them the action plan that allows them to focus on the right problems, judge the good solutions from the bad, and create action to create better cities.

### The approach
Essential to my method of solving the issues is defining what the root cause is. Often, consequences of root causes are defined as a problem. When you define a consequence of a root cause as a problem, you are tempted to find an apparent solution to that consequence, but often solutions tend to create new problems.

Say you have a disease, and this disease has a root cause, but you are constantly being treated with pills that give you a list of side effects. The cure would be removing the root cause. We are constantly treating our cities with pills with side effects. We have gotten to a point, where we are playing whack-a-mole with side-effects where the hammer is a new treatment.

- Urban sprawl is a consequence. Urban growth boundaries are treatments with side effects.
- The housing crisis is a consequence. Rent control policies are treatments with side effects.
- Excessive car use is a consequence. Registration taxes are treatments with side effects.

Key to achieving efficiency is creating more cures, and thus making treatments obsolete. I refer to cures as first-best solutions. First-best solutions are not always technologically possible, but the closer our solution lies to a first-best solution, the more efficient the outcome is.

Root causes are either market failures or government failures. They often have consequences in multiple areas. A transport related market failure can have consequences for urban sprawl. An urban sprawl related government failure can have consequences for the housing crisis.

Market failures call for first-best solutions. Government failures are often second-best solutions that need to be replaced. These are either an attempt to create equity or to reduce a market failure. In many cases, there are more efficient solutions to the market failures and more efficient ways to achieve equity.

### Collaboration
It is impossible for me to know everything, so I aim to use feedback to continuously update the consensus on this page once new information is presented. The key to science-based solutions is to value the truth higher than the idea.

## Overview
### 1. Urban sprawl
Root causes of urban sprawl:
- Excessive car use (see problem 3)
- Zoning and land-use regulations
- Height restrictions https://academic.oup.com/book/2269/chapter-abstract/142378551?redirectedFrom=fulltext
- Historic building preservation
- Spatially equal payment of public infrastructure (streets, sewers, parks, and schools, etc) despite spatially unequal costs
- Mortgage subsidies
- Open space amenities from farmland
- Too little emphasis on land value taxes as a means of government revenue as opposed to other taxes
- Land value speculation

Insufficient remedies:
- Urban growth boundaries

### 2. The housing crisis
Root causes of excessively high housing costs:
- Land speculation https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/zwick/files/jmp_111213.pdf
- Farming subsidies (outcompetes urban fringe land that should have been built up)
- Mortgage subsidies
- Land protection/urban growth boundaries/green belts
- Building restrictions: building heights or floor-area-ratio regulation, building purposes, land setbacks, minimum parking requirements, minimum lot sizes, building design codes.
- Rent ceilings
- Historic building preservation
- Low interest rates in central banks
- Minimum living area requirements
- Maximum number of tenants regulations

Insufficient remedies:
- Mortgage subsidies
- Rent ceilings
- Inclusionary zoning
- Public housing

### 3. Excessive car use
Root causes of excessive car use:
- Uninternalised negative external transport costs
- Free use of public roads
- Free parking
- Commuting subsidies
- Labour tax benefits for parking parking and/or commuting costs
- Company car tax benefits
- Urban sprawl (see problem 1)

Insufficient remedies:
- Second-best taxes (gas taxes, registration taxes, circulation taxes, cordon tolls)
- Subsidies for alternative modes
- Investment in alternative modes
- Banning cars in certain areas or zero emission zones
- Traffic efficiency engineering
