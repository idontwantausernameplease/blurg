Use Puga & Duranton (2015) and Brueckner (2011)

Talk briefly about supply and demand and the connection between rent and house prices. 

### Excessive car use
When it comes to car use, the closest thing we have to a first best policy is a combination of a GNSS based road pricing that would vary based on location, time, and vehicle driven in and parking pricing. It would replace all other taxes on cars and driving.

### Land speculation
A land value tax would stop land speculation. The closer the land value tax is to resemble the land rent, the less land speculation is possible. Without the ability to earn from owning land, but only from the improvements on the land, land owners will no longer have an incentive to hold on to land if they do not plan to build something they can rent out. This will automatically lower vacancy rates, increase the rate of construction, and encourage infill development eliminating this market failure leading to urban sprawl.

### Zoning and land use regulations
In this section, I will go through each of the following policies and provide an alternative option
- The use of the land (residential, commercial...)
- The form of the property
- Minimum parking requirements
- The internal structure of the property

#### The use of the land
The literature is not exactly clear if there is a doable first best solution to this problem, but a land value tax would compensate people for a land value decrease due to nuissance land use being developed close to them and a pigouvian tax or giving people the legal right and legal subsidy to not have nuissance from the factory would theoretically eliminate the problem of externalities. And a factory would naturally avoid locating in an area where they would have to deal with these costs. A pigouvian tax is likely not administratively feasible, and it is not sure how big the legal costs would be for such a system. Alternatively, such locations could be decided via quantitative GIS methods that could be made publicly available. However, it is very likely that zoning is more feasible, but that doesn't mean that zoning regulation can't be loosened. One way of doing this is to take a look at japanese zoning.

#### The form of the property
So what is the closest we can get to a first best policy to replace the existing policies? A land value tax would compensate people for reductions in land values through also decreasing their land value taxes. This would reduce the need for governments to protect the value of land and shift their interest towards increasing the value overall in the city. If a government wants to keep some lot size restrictions, building setbacks and height restrictions, there is no reasons they couldn't set these restrictions at a lower value to allow for more flexibility. An alternative way to deal with height externalities is to estimate land value impacts for a given lot at different heights and apply a tax to developers for that. This 3D GIS tool could be made publicly available. This would make developers consider their height choice while securing the maximum height that society is willing to pay. Utilities like trash collection can be consolidated into specific drop-off spots reducing the need to zone for that. Buildings could be set back closer to the roads.

#### Minimum parking requirements
There is a first best solution to this. If the city charges for on-street parking, and the building is free to decide how much space they want to allocate to parking, it is up to the building owner to make the best financial choice on how much parking is needed. They have an incentive not to overprovide on parking since it takes away land that can be rented out.

#### The internal structure of the property
This policy does not need to exist unless for the part that concerns safety. People should have the freedom to choose smaller dwellings for the lower price they entail. If politicians are concerned with equity, this makes housing *less* affordable, but there are also way more efficient ways of creating equity.

### Historic building preservation
It is difficult to separate the historic value and the value coming from the specific design, but maybe it's time for cities to explore options to loosen this regulation while keeping the integrity of these neighborhoods. Maybe it's possible to add floors while keeping the facade. Maybe it's possible to rebuild the building with more floors using the same design. There comes a certain point where the historic value cannot exceed the costs of the supply restriction coming from preserving it. At the same time, maybe our desire to preserve all historic district is a sign that there are design aspects or positive externalities of housing design that developers today are not fully internalisng to the extent they did in the past.

### Mortgage subsidies
Housing unaffordability cannot be solved through housing subsidies, so it should be repealed. If the government wants to solve the housing unaffordability crisis, it has to look at the market and government failures causing this crisis instead.

### Unbalanced infrastructure finance
Since it's hard to imagine a world where public infrastructure would be privatised even if done by the government, a first best solution isn't feasible, but we can get closer by differentiating taxes over space. A tool that gets quite close to this is a land value tax. Since the tax is on land, if there are 4 units on one plot of land, residents of each unit would pay a smaller tax, but they would also likely live in a place where the land value tax would be higher. This might reflect the fact that infrastructure is more expensive in urban areas per unit of land, but less expensive per person per unit of land.

### Open space and nature externalities
Where is the optimal level of development on nature? Unfortunately, this is dynamic and will change as population changes or preferences change. However, there is a way to take this into regard. If the city has a 100% tax on land rents, it means that whatever value is lost from building on new land can be assessed in land appraisals and it can then be weighed against the expected value of the new developments. If a city is good at land appraisals, it can then optimise on where and how big patches of park space should be added.

## The insufficient solution
### Urban growth boundary / green belts
Urban growth boundaries are a tool specifically used to limit spatial growth. The problem with urban growth boundaries is that there is no real way of determining where the boundaries optimally should be. Even if there was a way, those optimal boundaries would change over time, because a long list of dynamic parameters affects where the boundaries should be (Brueckner, 2000). This is another reason to solve the root causes; they tend to be much easier to calculate an optimal solution for. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721006256?casa_token=20oYyUq-KBEAAAAA:mLmGGlUMuyL7TXt-ZejT1FG2cMTfGDf316UuHSHKZ8YQluJCRU1A3qhPt_Ip3I51a5sMXVtdYA

This also means that it is difficult to compare the degree of urban sprawl between countries and maybe even regions. Because these may have different levels of population growth, income growth, preferences for suburbs, and transport costs. You can have a very spread out city with all market failures accounted for, but they may be spread out for legimitate reasons.Â 

## Summary

We need to get rid of or reduce the strictness of these:

We need to create these policies:
