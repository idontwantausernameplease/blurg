## The root causes
Use Puga & Duranton (2015) and Brueckner (2011)

Talk briefly about supply and demand and the connection between rent and house prices. 

### Excessive car use
Excessive car use is a consequence of a list of market and government failures. I list it as a consequence, because there will be a [whole section](/?p=excessive-driving-1) devoted to talking about the root causes of excessive car use. 

Car use has always had a dual relationship with outwards expansion of cities; as people can drive more (due to lower transport costs and higher income), they can live further away, and as people live further away, other modes of transport becomes less viable. If this car use is excessive, it will add more demand for outwards expansion that can be considered urban sprawl. 

The car use is excessive as long as infrastructure for car use (driving and parking) is provided without users paying for it and as long as there are uninternalised externalities of driving. So removing the "excessive" from "excessive car use" means dealing with each market and government failure individually and applying solutions as close to first best policy as possible. When it comes to car use, the closest thing we have to a first best policy is a combination of a GNSS based road pricing that would vary based on location, time, and vehicle driven in and parking pricing. It would replace all other taxes on cars and driving.

### Land speculation
Land speculation is a financial activity that involves purchasing land or real estate with the hope that it will increase in value. As long as land is scarce and populations are rising, land value is expected to increase higher than inflation, which makes it a bubble very unlikely to burst. This makes land a very attractive investment increasing the demand for investing in it.

Since it is such a good investment, land speculation makes it possible to earn from simply holding on to land, whether there is a building on it or not. This gives a land owner little incentive to actually create an improvement on the land. Even if there is an improvement on the land, and it is rented out, they have little incentive to improve it further. Simply put, the possibility of land speculation in the context of urban sprawl lowers vacancy rates in housing, decreases the rate of construction, and discourages infill development. All of these add pressure to outwards expansion. 

A land value tax would stop land speculation. The closer the land value tax is to resemble the land rent, the less land speculation is possible. Without the ability to earn from owning land, but only from the improvements on the land, land owners will no longer have an incentive to hold on to land if they do not plan to build something they can rent out. This will automatically lower vacancy rates, increase the rate of construction, and encourage infill development eliminating this market failure leading to urban sprawl.

### Zoning and land use regulations
Local and national governments have many rules on what can be built where and how. These include:
- The use of the land (residential, commercial...)
- The form of the property
- The 
- Minimum parking requirements
- Number of rooms or dwellings
- Minimum unit size
- Design of buildings
- Quality regulation
- Climate change & environmental regulation 

#### The use of the land
Regulating the use of land is done to protect and stabilise the value of land. A factory being built next to a residential area would have consequences for the land values as well as increased external costs coming from the factory through higher exposure to air, noise, and ground pollution. Without compensation for reduced land values and without internalisation of external costs, factories or other uses with nuisance would not be disincentivised to locate in suboptimal areas and we would get suboptimal land use. On the contrary, zoning too strictly can also result in inefficient outcomes since businesses and residences will not always be in their optimal locations. Strict zoning can mean that you cannot have a shop in your house or a restaurant across the street. The effect of this specific part of zoning on urban sprawl is actually not so clear, but too much separation of zones is likely making people more car dependent since the average distance to a destination is higher the more separated uses are, and car dependency is a function of proximity.

#### The form of the property
The zoning regulations of the use of land usually also specifies the form of a building. This includes the type of building (single-family detached housing, duplexes, rowhouses etc.), height restrictions, minimum lot size restrictions, and building setbacks/frontage/garden space. 




The literature is not exactly clear if there is a doable first best solution to this problem, but a land value tax would eliminate the first of the problems above and a pigouvian tax would eliminate the second problem. Since a pigouvian tax on such a small scale would be administratively infeasable at this point, it is probably best to work within the 



A common recent approach (see, for example, Ihlanfeldt 2007) is to measure the intensity of land-use restrictions using data from a survey of local governments. The survey indicates how many types of restrictions each government has in place (whether it has a UGB, levies impact fees, and so on), and the intensity measure is a simple count of the number of restrictions. This count measure is then used as an explanatory variable in a regression in which the dependent variable is a house price measure. The regression includes a variety of other control variables. The results from this type of study typically show the expected effect: house prices in a locality rise with an increase in the number of land restrictions in place.

Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) measured the gap between the price per square foot of housing and construction cost per square foot in different communities. Noting that the two values should be equal in a competitive market, they argue that a large gap indicates the presence of government regulations that inhibit housing supply. - as seen in bruckner 2011.

## The insufficient remedy
### Urban growth boundary / green belts
Urban growth boundaries are a tool specifically used to limit spatial growth. The problem with urban growth boundaries is that there is no real way of determining where the boundaries optimally should be. Even if there was a way, those optimal boundaries would change over time, because a long list of dynamic parameters affects where the boundaries should be (Brueckner, 2000). This is another reason to solve the root causes; they tend to be much easier to calculate an optimal solution for. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721006256?casa_token=20oYyUq-KBEAAAAA:mLmGGlUMuyL7TXt-ZejT1FG2cMTfGDf316UuHSHKZ8YQluJCRU1A3qhPt_Ip3I51a5sMXVtdYA

This also means that it is difficult to compare the degree of urban sprawl between countries and maybe even regions. Because these may have different levels of population growth, income growth, preferences for suburbs, and transport costs. You can have a very spread out city with all market failures accounted for, but they may be spread out for legimitate reasons.Â
