## The root causes
Use Puga & Duranton (2015) and Brueckner (2011)

### Excessive car use
Excessive car use is a consequence of a [list of market and government failures](/?p=excessive-driving-1). I list it as a consequence, because there will be a whole section devoted to talking about the root causes of excessive car use. 

Car use has always had a dual relationship with outwards expansion of cities; as people can drive more (due to lower transport costs and higher income), they can live further away, and as people live further away, other modes of transport becomes less viable. If this car use is excessive, it will add more demand for outwards expansion that can be considered urban sprawl. The car use is excessive as long as infrastructure for car use is provided without users paying for it and as long as there are uninternalised externalities of driving.

### Zoning and land-use regulations
A common recent approach (see, for example, Ihlanfeldt 2007) is to measure the intensity of land-use restrictions using data from a survey of local governments. The survey indicates how many types of restrictions each government has in place (whether it has a UGB, levies impact fees, and so on), and the intensity measure is a simple count of the number of restrictions. This count measure is then used as an explanatory variable in a regression in which the dependent variable is a house price measure. The regression includes a variety of other control variables. The results from this type of study typically show the expected effect: house prices in a locality rise with an increase in the number of land restrictions in place.

Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) measured the gap between the price per square foot of housing and construction cost per square foot in different communities. Noting that the two values should be equal in a competitive market, they argue that a large gap indicates the presence of government regulations that inhibit housing supply. - as seen in bruckner 2011.

## The insufficient remedy
### Urban growth boundary / green belts
Urban growth boundaries are a tool specifically used to limit spatial growth. The problem with urban growth boundaries is that there is no real way of determining where the boundaries optimally should be. Even if there was a way, those optimal boundaries would change over time, because a long list of dynamic parameters affects where the boundaries should be (Brueckner, 2000). This is another reason to solve the root causes; they tend to be much easier to calculate an optimal solution for. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721006256?casa_token=20oYyUq-KBEAAAAA:mLmGGlUMuyL7TXt-ZejT1FG2cMTfGDf316UuHSHKZ8YQluJCRU1A3qhPt_Ip3I51a5sMXVtdYA

This also means that it is difficult to compare the degree of urban sprawl between countries and maybe even regions. Because these may have different levels of population growth, income growth, preferences for suburbs, and transport costs. You can have a very spread out city with all market failures accounted for, but they may be spread out for legimitate reasons.Â
