## The root causes
Use Puga & Duranton (2015) and Brueckner (2011)

Talk briefly about supply and demand and the connection between rent and house prices. 

### Excessive car use
Excessive car use is a consequence of a list of market and government failures. I list it as a consequence, because there will be a [whole section](/?p=excessive-driving-1) devoted to talking about the root causes of excessive car use. 

Car use has always had a dual relationship with outwards expansion of cities; as people can drive more (due to lower transport costs and higher income), they can live further away, and as people live further away, other modes of transport becomes less viable. If this car use is excessive, it will add more demand for outwards expansion that can be considered urban sprawl. 

The car use is excessive as long as infrastructure for car use (driving and parking) is provided without users paying for it and as long as there are uninternalised externalities of driving. So removing the "excessive" from "excessive car use" means dealing with each market and government failure individually and applying solutions as close to first best policy as possible. When it comes to car use, the closest thing we have to a first best policy is a combination of a GNSS based road pricing that would vary based on location, time, and vehicle driven in and parking pricing. It would replace all other taxes on cars and driving.

### Land speculation
Land speculation is a financial activity that involves purchasing land or real estate with the hope that it will increase in value. As long as land is scarce and populations are rising, land value is expected to increase higher than inflation, which makes it a bubble very unlikely to burst. This makes land a very attractive investment increasing the demand for investing in it.

Since it is such a good investment, land speculation makes it possible to earn from simply holding on to land, whether there is a building on it or not. This gives a land owner little incentive to actually create an improvement on the land. Even if there is an improvement on the land, and it is rented out, they have little incentive to improve it further. Simply put, the possibility of land speculation in the context of urban sprawl lowers vacancy rates in housing, decreases the rate of construction, and discourages infill development. All of these add pressure to outwards expansion. 

A land value tax would stop land speculation. The closer the land value tax is to resemble the land rent, the less land speculation is possible. Without the ability to earn from owning land, but only from the improvements on the land, land owners will no longer have an incentive to hold on to land if they do not plan to build something they can rent out. This will automatically lower vacancy rates, increase the rate of construction, and encourage infill development eliminating this market failure leading to urban sprawl.

### Zoning and land use regulations
Local and national governments have many rules on what can be built where and how. These include:
- The use of the land (residential, commercial...)
- The form of the property
- Minimum parking requirements
- The internal structure of the property
- Other

#### The use of the land
Regulating the use of land is done to protect and stabilise the value of land. A factory being built next to a residential area would have consequences for the land values as well as increased external costs coming from the factory through higher exposure to air, noise, and ground pollution. Without compensation for reduced land values and without internalisation of external costs, factories or other uses with nuisance would not be disincentivised to locate in suboptimal areas and we would get suboptimal land use. On the contrary, zoning too strictly can also result in inefficient outcomes since businesses and residences will not always be in their optimal locations. Strict zoning can mean that you cannot have a shop in your house or a restaurant across the street. The effect of this specific part of zoning on urban sprawl is actually not so clear, but too much separation of zones is likely making people more car dependent since the average distance to a destination is higher the more separated uses are, and car dependency is a function of proximity.  

The literature is not exactly clear if there is a doable first best solution to this problem, but a land value tax would eliminate the first of the problems above and a pigouvian tax would eliminate the second problem. Since a pigouvian tax on such a small scale would be administratively infeasable at this point, it is probably best to work within the framework of zoning and loosen them. One way of doing this is to take a look at japanese zoning.

#### The form of the property
The zoning regulations of the use of land usually also specifies the form of a building. This includes the type of building (single-family detached housing, duplexes, rowhouses etc.), height restrictions, minimum lot size restrictions, and building setbacks/frontage/garden space. All of these have the purpose to protect land values. A tall building may cast a shadow on a lot of buildings, utilities may need to be able to reach buildings, buildings with high variation in setbacks may provide an unaesthetic lack of uniformity, and small irregular lots can create issues with property rights. However, all these restrictions either increase the average dwelling size or decrease the amount of dwellings per unit of land - both of which adds pressure to outward expansion that can be considered urban sprawl. 

So what is the closest we can get to a first best policy to replace the existing policies? A land value tax would compensate people for reductions in land values through also decreasing their land value taxes. This would reduce the need for governments to protect the value of land. If a government wants to keep some lot size restrictions, building setbacks and height restrictions, there is no reasons they couldn't set these restrictions at a lower value to allow for more flexibility. An alternative way to deal with height externalities is to estimate land value impacts for a given lot at different heights and apply a tax to developers for that. This 3D GIS tool could be made publicly available. This would make developers consider their height choice while securing the maximum height that society is willing to pay. Utilities like trash collection can be consolidated into specific drop-off spots reducing the need to zone for that. Buildings could be set back closer to the roads. 

#### Minimum parking requirements
To alleviate the pressure of on-street parking demand, some cities have chosen to mandate minimum parking requirements in certain locations. This means that dependent on the assumed parking demand of the building, the government will set a minimum amount of parking spots required for development. This is often done because the buildings otherwise take advantage of the free parking provided by the street, which creates a shortage of parking spots unless they are priced. Similar to building setbacks, this lowers the amount of dwellings per unit of land and means less space for real estate than optimal resulting in outwards expansion pressure that we can call urban sprawl. 

There is a first best solution to this. If the city charges for on-street parking, and the building is free to decide how much space they want to allocate to parking, it is up to the building owner to make the best financial choice on how much parking is needed. They have an incentive not to overprovide on parking since it takes away land that can be rented out.

#### The internal structure of the property
Sometimes governments have laws regarding the internal structure of the building. Relevant to urban sprawl is regulations on the minimum room size, the minimum dwelling size, and the minimum amount of rooms per resident. Some of these are done for safety purposes, and others are done to raise the minimum standard of living. Some have complained that "greedy developers" have built too small, which have resulted in increasing the minimum dwelling size required. Unfortunately some people might have been willing to live in that space for the lower price it would have. All of these laws increase the average dwelling size and thus contributes to pressure for outwards expansion leading to more urban sprawl. 

This policy does not need to exist unless for the part that concerns safety. People should have the freedom to choose smaller dwellings for the lower price they entail. If politicians are concerned with equity, this makes housing *less* affordable, but there are also way more efficient ways of creating equity. 

#### Other
Governments also regulate the design of buildings, sets standards for quality control, and sets standards for sustainability. While these may be costly additions for developers and there might be first best solutions to some of them, they also are not expected to have important implications for urban sprawl. 

#### Zoning and land use regulations revisited
In general, there are a lot of zoning and land use regulations that directly influence urban sprawl. Some of these can be replaced by first best policy, some can be loosened, and some can be completely removed. All of these would reduce problems of urban sprawl.

### Historic building preservation
Historic building preservation is done because old city centres have a historic amenity (koster article). The age of the buildings are considered to be valued by the citizens. It is not exactly clear how much of this value is derived from the age of the building itself or it's historic properties and how much is from specific design choices that could be copied today, but historic areas do have value. However, preserving old buildings also functions as a height restriction since buildings cannot be rebuilt at higher densities to deal with changing demands. This limits both the average dwelling size and the amount of dwellings per land resulting in urban sprawl.
  
It is difficult to separate the historic value and the value coming from the specific design, but maybe it's time for cities to explore options to loosen this regulation while keeping the integrity of these neighborhoods. Maybe it's possible to add floors while keeping the facade. Maybe it's possible to rebuild the building with more floors using the same design. There comes a certain point where the historic value cannot exceed the costs of the supply restriction coming from preserving it. At the same time, maybe our desire to preserve all historic district is a sign that there are design aspects or positive externalities of housing design that developers today are not fully internalisng to the extent they did in the past. 

### Mortgage subsidies
Mortgage subsidies are often a tool used to help people afford housing in a time of difficulty in doing so. Instead of focusing on why that doesn't work, I want to put focus on how it affects urban sprawl. Since most loans in housing are made for single-family detached housing, a housing mortgage subsidy favors purchases of single-family detached houses more than apartments. This means that a demand is induced for single-family detached housing. A type of housing taking more space. At the same time it gives homebuyers more purchasing power to buy bigger homes with larger lots resulting in taking even more space. Both of these create pressure for outwards expansion and thus result in urban sprawl. 
  
Housing unaffordability cannot be solved through housing subsidies, so it should be repealed. If the government wants to solve the housing unaffordability crisis, it has to look at the market and government failures causing this crisis instead.

### Unbalanced infrastructure finance
We all pay taxes in the location we live in. These taxes are fairly equal across space. However the costs of the public infrastructure provided is very unequal per citizen across space. In the suburbs, the costs of providing infrastructure is a lot more costly per person than in more urban areas. This is because of economies of scale and cost sharing. Since it's hard to imagine a world where this infrastructure would be privatised, a first best solution isn't feasible, but we can get closer by differentiating taxes over space. A tool that gets quite close to this is a land value tax. Since the tax is on land, if there are 4 units on one plot of land, residents of each unit would pay a smaller tax, but they would also likely live in a place where the land value tax would be higher. This might reflect the fact that infrastructure is more expensive in urban areas per unit of land, but less expensive per person per unit of land. 
  
### Open space and nature externalities
Nature and open space around cities provide citizens with positive amenities. People get joy out of having access to nature. Building on nature would thus cause some reductions in land values. However, being too strict on where to build can have serious impacts on housing affordability. Where is the optimal level of development on nature? Unfortunately, this is dynamic and will change as population changes or preferences change. However, there is a way to take this into regard. If the city has a 100% tax on land rents, it means that whatever value is lost from building on new land can be assessed in land appraisals and it can then be weighed against the expected value of the new developments. If a city is good at land appraisals, it can then optimise on where and how big patches of park space should be added. 


## The insufficient remedy
### Urban growth boundary / green belts
Urban growth boundaries are a tool specifically used to limit spatial growth. The problem with urban growth boundaries is that there is no real way of determining where the boundaries optimally should be. Even if there was a way, those optimal boundaries would change over time, because a long list of dynamic parameters affects where the boundaries should be (Brueckner, 2000). This is another reason to solve the root causes; they tend to be much easier to calculate an optimal solution for. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721006256?casa_token=20oYyUq-KBEAAAAA:mLmGGlUMuyL7TXt-ZejT1FG2cMTfGDf316UuHSHKZ8YQluJCRU1A3qhPt_Ip3I51a5sMXVtdYA

This also means that it is difficult to compare the degree of urban sprawl between countries and maybe even regions. Because these may have different levels of population growth, income growth, preferences for suburbs, and transport costs. You can have a very spread out city with all market failures accounted for, but they may be spread out for legimitate reasons.Â
