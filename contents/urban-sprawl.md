# Urban sprawl
Outwards spatial growth of cities is a natural occurrence happening from population increases. Still, sometimes this expansion is exaggerated due to market failures or government failures and then we get urban sprawl. In this article, I explain when exactly spatial growth is excessive and I identify, which problems do and don't cause this excess.

## The difference between urban sprawl and spatial growth
When cities grow, they do so both outwards and upwards. There is a slight trade-off between the two: Limits to outwards expansion creates more pressure for upwards expansion and vice versa. Both urban sprawl and spatial growth refers to outwards expansion. When it comes to urban sprawl, I prefer using Brueckner's (2000) definition, which is "*excessive* spatial growth" with emphasis on *excessive*. This definition implies that:
- Urban sprawl is undesirable
- Spatial growth/outwards expansion is not necessarily undesirable

This distinction is important, because spatial growth is a natural part of human progress. It happens for instance when:
- Populations increase
- Incomes increase

When populations increase, demand for housing increases, and since it is not efficient to accomodate these people solely through upwards expansion, agricultural land gets outbidded for urban development due to the outwards pressure. Increasing income increases demand for more space and has similar effects. Spatial growth from increase in population or income is by Brueckner **not** enough to classify the expansion as urban sprawl.

PS. If you worry that this eventually will be the end of the world, according to Hans Rosling, [population growth will eventually reach zero](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_global_population_growth_box_by_box?language=en) and economically, there will always be an equilibrium balance between agricultural land and urban land. When it comes to natural space, there is a field of environmental economists and natural resource economists who have a lot of great ideas for that, that I will touch a bit upon later. 

Some factors drive urban growth into either upward or outward:
- Outward: Improvements in transport technology
- Upward: Improvements in construction technology
- Outward: Increased preferences for proximity to nature and more space 
- Upward: Increased preferences for proximity to shops, museums and other urban amenities

Spatial growth from improvements in transport technology or increased preferences for proximity to nature or more space is by Bruckner **not** enough to classify expansion as urban sprawl. 

So when is spatial growth considered urban sprawl? 
The part of spatial growth that can be considered urban sprawl comes from the economic problems that lead to excessive outwards expansion. I explain the importance of how we define the problem in the next section. 

## Solving an economic problem can be like curing a disease
Let's say you are born with a disease with certain symptoms. It is not deadly, but it keeps you from living your full potential. If you are lucky, there is a cure, which will end the disease without side effects. Alternatively, you can treat the symptoms using a treatment that may have side effects and might not completely resolve all the symptoms. 
Cures might sometimes involve a bigger investment, but will be more beneficial in the long run through creating less side effects. If you have gotten used to certain treatments, your body might also need time to adapt to the cure. 

Similarly, market failures inately exist everywhere in the world, they do not shut down all economies, but they keep them from reaching their potential. Some market failures have first-best policies, which solve the market failure without unintended unpredictable consequences, and some have second-best policies, which produce unintended unpredictable consequences that may need new policies and may not fully solve the market failure.
First-best policies are sometimes more costly, but in the long run they will be more beneficial because they create less consequences to develop policy for. As you develop more policies to deal with all these consequences, it becomes more difficult to switch to a better policy as society adapts to the other policies. 

However, as society grows, first-best policies become technologically more feasible. This analogy has two main implications: Firstly, it calls for a focus shift toward defining problems based on the root cause rather than the consequence. Secondly, it calls for a focus shift toward getting better at using first-best policy when possible.

Getting back to urban sprawl, by Brueckner (2000), urban sprawl is a *consequence* of a list of market and government failures. Defining urban sprawl as the problem is like choosing to focus on the symptoms rather than the disease. Doing so, also creates a confusing landscape in terms of figuring out when urban sprawl is solved. 

## Root causes of urban sprawl
The market and government failures leading to urban sprawl are:
- Excessive car use
- Zoning and land-use regulations
- Height restrictions https://academic.oup.com/book/2269/chapter-abstract/142378551?redirectedFrom=fulltext
- Historic building protection
- Spatially equal payment of public infrastructure (streets, sewers, parks, and schools, etc) despite spatially unequal costs
- Mortgage subsidies
- Open space amenities from farmland
- Too little emphasis on land value taxes as a means of government revenue as opposed to other taxes
- Land value speculations
- Assigning no value to open space or nature

Clicking on any of these will lead to a description of the problem and their solution. 

Some other policies indirectly limit spatial growth:
- Farming subsidies
- Nature protection

They don't do so without consequences (link to housing crisis article) and are not nearly enough to counteract the problems of urban sprawl, so they cannot be seen as solutions.

## Insufficient remidies:
Commonly advocated as a solution to urban sprawl:
- Urban growth boundaries / green belts

Urban growth boundaries are a tool specifically used to limit spatial growth. The problem with urban growth boundaries is that there is no real way of determining where the boundaries optimally should be. Even if there was a way, those optimal boundaries would change over time, because a long list of dynamic parameters affects where the boundaries should be (Brueckner, 2000). This is another reason to solve the root causes; they tend to be much easier to calculate an optimal solution for. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721006256?casa_token=20oYyUq-KBEAAAAA:mLmGGlUMuyL7TXt-ZejT1FG2cMTfGDf316UuHSHKZ8YQluJCRU1A3qhPt_Ip3I51a5sMXVtdYA

This also means that it is difficult to compare the degree of urban sprawl between countries and maybe even regions. Because these may have different levels of population growth, income growth, preferences for suburbs, and transport costs. You can have a very spread out city with all market failures accounted for, but they may be spread out for legimitate reasons. 

## Other critiques of urban sprawl
While urban sprawl is mostly a consequence of distortions (an umbrella term for government and market failures), urban sprawl also contributes to some consequences.

Brueckner & Helsley (2011) have found a connection between urban sprawl and the neglect of central city development causing inner city decay and blight. The mechanism is, that if you can develop on the fringe, there is less incentive to develop and maintain the downtown. Bradford & Kelejian (1973) has argued that the opposite is true: blight can cause urban sprawl. Brueckner (2011) argues that both likely have an element of truth.

Other critics of urban sprawl such as Burchfield et al. (2006) say that it causes scattered development leaving patches of land within the city undeveloped, which leaves wasted infrastructure and further excessive travel distances. There may be benefits of these patches in terms of leaving space for denser developments later on, but these patterns still involve some problems.

Some critics say that lower urban density areas have fewer cases of social interaction, which can cause mental and social problems, but Brueckner & Largey (2008) found that the opposite is the case. The lower the urban density, the more social interaction.

Some researchers have shown correlations between obesity and urban sprawl. However, Eid et al. (2008) find that the more likely explanation is that obese people are more likely to live in the suburbs; he found that people who move to suburbs or inner cities do not change their weight.

It is also often argued that we have to be careful not to take too much farmland away, but this argument is misguided. The value of farmland is fully reflected in the price developers pay for the land. If developers decide to buy farmland, it means that whatever use the developers have for the land is worth more than whatever use the farmers had for the land. If farmland became truly scarce and in need of preservation, its selling price would be high, making the land resistant to urban encroachment.

I have argued that urban sprawl is not only a result of artificially high transport demand (via low transport prices), but it also exacerbates the artificially high transport demand (via creating living spaces that encourage car use). The mechanism is that transport prices influence how many people use a car and how much they use them. This in turn makes people demand more car infrastructure, less infrastructure for other modes, and more low-density (sparse) housing. If the prices then are to increase, the infrastructure and the low-density developments will still exist and may never change or take decades to change. Urban sprawl thus makes transport problems very long-run problems, and the sooner it can be dealt with, the less it will burden us over time.

Regardless of the validity of these extra problems of urban sprawl, they do not pose a reason to limit spatial growth, but rather increase the urgency of solving the root causes. The root causes themselves create inefficiencies apart from just contributing to urban sprawl.

## Conclusions
Urban sprawl itself is not a problem, it's a consequence of a set of market and government failures that either produce the problem or try to combat it inefficiently. The most efficient way to solve it would be to look to the root of the problems by tackling the market failures and the policies that cause them.

I argue that the extra problems of urban sprawl pose an urgency to solve the root causes of urban sprawl rather than creating reasons to limit urban sprawl through new policies.
