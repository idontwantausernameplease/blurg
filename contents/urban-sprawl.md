# Urban sprawl
Outwards spatial growth of cities is a natural occurrence happening from population increases. Still, sometimes this expansion is exaggerated due to market failures or government failures and then we get urban sprawl. In this article, I explain when exactly spatial growth is excessive and I identify, which problems do and don't cause this excess.

## What is urban sprawl?
When a city grows, it either expands upwards or outwards. If a city grew its population, but neither expanded outwards nor upwards, its citizens would have drastically and increasingly decreasing life quality through insufficient space. I will refer to outward expansion as spatial growth.

When it comes to urban sprawl, I prefer using Brueckner's (2000) definition, which is "excessive spatial growth" with emphasis on excessive. This definition implies that:
- Urban sprawl is undesirable
- Spatial growth/outwards expansion is not necessarily undesirable

But when is spatial growth considered urban sprawl? Many circumstances affect the growth of a city and whether this growth happens upwards or outwards. Some of these circumstances are problematic and others are neutral or signs of a growing economy. A key difference in solving the issue of urban sprawl is understanding which of these circumstances are problematic, so first let me explain how I like to determine this.

## The economic problem framework
In microeconomics, we recognize that market failures and government failures create situations where society is worse off. The existence of these is often the root of resulting consequences, which are often treated as new problems to create solutions for. 

For this reason, we believe that resolving the root cause of the disease (the market failure) rather than treating the symptoms (consequences of the market failure) leads to a more efficient society. The reason for this is that treatments tend to have side effects (government failures), which may need new treatments. These costs can add up.

Market failures naturally occur from new technologies, natural laws, or from rational human behavior. We cannot expect people to automatically change their behavior, we don't want to stop technological development and we can't change the laws of nature, but economists have developed tools that deal with market failures. Government failures are when government decisions lead to inefficient outcomes and sometimes are a result of an attempt to solve a market failure.

In this framework, urban sprawl is not a problem, but a consequence coming from market failures and government failures that areunique in the way that it tends to make some of the market failures worse.

## Positive causes of spatial growth and spatial confinement
Since not all spatial growth undesirable, I thought I should list some reasons for spatial growth that are fine: 
- Population increasing (we can't all fit in the same building)
- Incomes increasing (we want more when we can afford more)
- Transportation becoming relatively faster/cheaper (the ability to travel farther makes people willing to live further from jobs)
- Change in people's preferences (it may become trendy to have a garden which is more costly in the city)

I describe these causes as positive because they either have no negative economic consequences themselves (quite the contrary), or they derive from a part of human nature that the field of economics does not criticize such as preferences or reproduction.

Some positive reasons that push cities in the direction of less spatial growth and perhaps even more upwards growth also exist.

- Improvements in building technology and reductions in engineering costs (fewer costs associated with building tall buildings results more upwards growth)
- Change in people's preference for how much they are willing to pay for urban living (it may be trendy to live the cosmopolitan life, which creates a shift from suburban to urban living)
- Urban amenities (the more a city has to offer within a certain time distance, the more people get attracted to it)

## Reasons for urban sprawl caused by market or government failures and common "treatments"
The root causes leading to urban sprawl are:
- Excessive car use
- Zoning and land-use regulations
- Height restrictions https://academic.oup.com/book/2269/chapter-abstract/142378551?redirectedFrom=fulltext
- Historic building protection
- Spatially equal payment of public infrastructure (streets, sewers, parks, and schools, etc) despite spatially unequal costs
- Mortgage subsidies
- Open space amenities from farmland
- Too little emphasis on land value taxes as a means of government revenue as opposed to other taxes
- Land value speculations

Some other policies indirectly limit spatial growth:
- Farming subsidies
- Nature protection

They don't do so without consequences and are not nearly enough to counteract the problems of urban sprawl, so they cannot be seen as solutions.

Insufficient remidies:
- Urban growth boundaries / green belts

Urban growth boundaries are a tool specifically used to limit spatial growth. The problem with urban growth boundaries is that there is no real way of determining where the boundaries optimally should be. Even if there was a way, those optimal boundaries would change over time, because a long list of dynamic parameters affects where the boundaries should be (Brueckner, 2000). This is another reason to solve the root causes; they tend to be much easier to calculate an optimal solution for. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721006256?casa_token=20oYyUq-KBEAAAAA:mLmGGlUMuyL7TXt-ZejT1FG2cMTfGDf316UuHSHKZ8YQluJCRU1A3qhPt_Ip3I51a5sMXVtdYA

This also means that it is difficult to compare the degree of urban sprawl between countries and maybe even regions. Because these may have different levels of population growth, income growth, preferences for suburbs, and transport costs. You can have a very spread out city with all market failures accounted for, but they may be spread out for legimitate reasons. 

## Other critiques of urban sprawl
While urban sprawl is mostly a consequence of distortions (an umbrella term for government and market failures), urban sprawl also contributes to some consequences.

Brueckner & Helsley (2011) have found a connection between urban sprawl and the neglect of central city development causing inner city decay and blight. The mechanism is, that if you can develop on the fringe, there is less incentive to develop and maintain the downtown. Bradford & Kelejian (1973) has argued that the opposite is true: blight can cause urban sprawl. Brueckner (2011) argues that both likely have an element of truth.

Other critics of urban sprawl such as Burchfield et al. (2006) say that it causes scattered development leaving patches of land within the city undeveloped, which leaves wasted infrastructure and further excessive travel distances. There may be benefits of these patches in terms of leaving space for denser developments later on, but these patterns still involve some problems.

Some critics say that lower urban density areas have fewer cases of social interaction, which can cause mental and social problems, but Brueckner & Largey (2008) found that the opposite is the case. The lower the urban density, the more social interaction.

Some researchers have shown correlations between obesity and urban sprawl. However, Eid et al. (2008) find that the more likely explanation is that obese people are more likely to live in the suburbs; he found that people who move to suburbs or inner cities do not change their weight.

It is also often argued that we have to be careful not to take too much farmland away, but this argument is misguided. The value of farmland is fully reflected in the price developers pay for the land. If developers decide to buy farmland, it means that whatever use the developers have for the land is worth more than whatever use the farmers had for the land. If farmland became truly scarce and in need of preservation, its selling price would be high, making the land resistant to urban encroachment.

I have argued that urban sprawl is not only a result of artificially high transport demand (via low transport prices), but it also exacerbates the artificially high transport demand (via creating living spaces that encourage car use). The mechanism is that transport prices influence how many people use a car and how much they use them. This in turn makes people demand more car infrastructure, less infrastructure for other modes, and more low-density (sparse) housing. If the prices then are to increase, the infrastructure and the low-density developments will still exist and may never change or take decades to change. Urban sprawl thus makes transport problems very long-run problems, and the sooner it can be dealt with, the less it will burden us over time.

Regardless of the validity of these extra problems of urban sprawl, they do not pose a reason to limit spatial growth, but rather increase the urgency of solving the root causes. The root causes (the market and government failures) themselves create inefficiencies apart from just contributing to urban sprawl.

## Conclusions
Urban sprawl itself is not a problem, it's a consequence of a set of market and government failures that either produce the problem or try to combat it inefficiently. The most efficient way to solve it would be to look to the root of the problem by tackling the market failures and the policies that cause them.

I argue that the extra problems of urban sprawl pose an urgency to solve the root causes of urban sprawl rather than creating reasons to limit urban sprawl through new policies.
