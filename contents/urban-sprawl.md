# Urban Sprawl

## The similarities between our bodies and our cities

[Add picture of a person in a house with mold looking sick taking pills]

Imagine you get a daily horrible headache caused by mold in your apartment, but instead of finding and removing the mold, you go to a doctor and get prescribed some strong pain-killers, which removes the headache while you keep taking them, but with a list of side effects.

Just like our bodies, cities can be subject to different kinds mold which each create their own symptoms. But cities tend to use medication with side effects rather than resolving the root causes - even when we have identified the root causes and have solutions to get rid of them. This gap between knowledge and action is what these articles aims to bridge. 

If Medical Science is the study of the health of our bodies, Urban Economics is the study of the health of our cities. Neither Medical Science or Urban Economics claims to have all the answers. In fact, they quite often need help from specialists in different areas, who all contribute to the knowledge that helps doctors of bodies and cities make decisions. We all work together with the same goal: to improve the long term thriving of people on this planet.

  <summary>But isn't economics all about benefitting corporations and making the rich richer?</summary>

  Capitalism and economics are not the same thing. Economics is about balance. About getting the most out of the least in a world with scarce resources such as land. Ideally, the balance would just be determined by the supply and demand of land, and you would automatically land on that spot through Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, but we discovered about 100 years ago, that market failures exist, and without solving these, we end up worse off.

## Urban sprawl as a symptom

One big symptom that a lot of cities face is urban sprawl. Urban sprawl has been criticised for making people more car-dependent (which has it's own problems LINK TO OTHER ARTICLE), for making public services more expensive, and for making citizens more unhealthy. However, urban sprawl is not to be confused with mere outwards expansion of cities. 

To be honest, despite growing up in the suburbs, I never really understood suburban living, but I respect that people do, and I want them to have the freedom to spend those hours commuting, maintaining their properties and seeing the same people every day. Jokes aside, despite my personal preference, there is nothing wrong with cities expanding outwards. Cities expand outwards when populations increase, faster transport is invented, higher incomes are earned or people change preferences. Without expansion we are depriving ourselves from something we want: space - even if you live in an apartment. So cities expanding is like puberty. It’s a natural process that involves some changes that we accept.

  <summary>But wont we just end up expanding onto all farmland and agricultural land?</summary>
    
  **Won't populations keep rising?** According to Hans Rosling, [population growth rate will eventually reach zero](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_global_population_growth_box_by_box?language=en). This is due to the reduced birthrate as a country develops. In developed countries the growth rate is already close to 0 and most growth comes from immigration.
  
  **Won't we keep expanding onto agricultural land?** For this, I will cite Brueckner ([2000](https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/inrsre/v23y2000i2p160-171.html)): "Concerns about loss of “scarce” farmland are also misplaced. Because the value of farm output is fully reflected in the amount that agricultural users are willing to pay for the land, a successful bid by developers means that society values the houses and other structures built on the land more than the farm output that is forgone. If farmland became truly scarce and in need of preservation, its selling price would be high, making the land resistant to urban encroachment. With only a tiny fraction of the U.S. land area occupied by cities, farmland scarcity is not a problem currently, nor is it likely to become a problem in the future."
  
  **Won't we keep expanding onto nature?** For now, this is mostly a democratic process of nature reservation. This part is a much less developed field in economics, but there are fields of nature ressource economics, environmental economics, and climate change economics. These fields develop models to help determine the value of nature and it's worth to us. This can help us create the right balance of nature reservation and development. Since I myself believe that nature is essential to human survival in the long run, I think these models will become an essential part of international politics and spatial policy making. Eventually, we could be able to put a value to nature, which can help us decide where to build and keep a reasonable balance. One must also recognise that sometimes building on nature *is* the more sustainable choice, since building on another plot of land further away would lead to citizens living with less sustainable behaviour such as driving a car for more kilometers.

A good way to explain how cities expand is through the monocentric city model. All you need to know is that it's an economic model that crudely models citizen behaviour in a market of housing around a city centre that everyone commutes to, but I will add more details below for the fellow nerds. 

<details>
  <summary>How does the monocentric city model work?</summary>
    
  The monocentric city model, developed by Alonso, Muth & Mills, is a fundamental concept in urban economics that provides insight into the spatial structure of cities. Here's how it works, along with its critiques and defenses:
    
  ### How It Works
    
  The monocentric city model assumes that a city has a single center (usually the Central Business District, or CBD) to which all residents commute. The basic idea is as follows:
    
  1. **Central Business District:** The CBD is where most jobs and activities are located.
  2. **Residential location choice:** As one moves away from the CBD, housing costs decrease, but commuting costs increase. People choose their residential location based on a trade-off between these two factors.
  3. **Effects of Changes:** By changing factors like population, transport costs, or income, we can illustrate how the urban border and distributions of urban density, house prices, floor-area-ratios, and housing consumption will shift.
    
  This simple model has been widely used to explain real-world urban patterns, like why housing costs more in city centers. 
    
  The specific model used in these interactive graphs is written in R and is available on Github. 
    
  ### Critique of the Monocentric City Model
    
  Despite its widespread use, the monocentric city model has several critiques:
    
  1. **Monocentricity:** It assumes a single center and uniform transportation costs, ignoring the complexity of modern urban landscapes with multiple centers, and scattered jobs. 
  2. **Ignores political, cultural and geographic factors:** History, preferences, and geographical factors all influence how a city is shaped. 
  3. **Homogeneity:** The model assumes that everyone works the same place, has the same preferences, and has the same income. 
    
  ### Critique of the Critique: Why It Still Fits
    
  While the critiques are valid, the model's defenders argue:
    
  1. **Pedagogical Tool:** The model is valuable as a teaching tool, helping students and laypeople grasp fundamental urban economic concepts.
  2. **Basis for More Complex Models:** Many advanced models build upon the monocentric city model, adding layers of complexity.
  3. **Explains General Trends:** Despite its simplicity, the model can still capture broad trends and patterns in many cities. Liotta et al. (2021) found that “As expected, cities spread out when they are richer, more populated, and when transportation or farmland is cheaper. Respectively 100% and 87% of the cities exhibit the expected negative density and rent gradients: on average, a 1% decrease in income net of transportation costs leads to a 21% decrease in densities and a 3% decrease in rents per m2.” 
    
  ### How It Fits for the Purpose of Explanation
    
  In the context of urban sprawl, the monocentric city model serves as a useful analogy. While it may not perfectly describe every city, it helps us understand why cities expand outward, the trade-offs between living in the center versus the periphery, and the economic forces at play. It's like a foundational sketch that captures the essence of urban growth without getting lost in every intricate detail.
    
  By acknowledging its limitations and leveraging its strengths, we can use the monocentric city model as a valuable starting point in a broader conversation about urban development, sprawl, and sustainability.

The model makes you able to plot the urban density (people per square kilometer) by distance to the centre including where the border of the city is. We are then able to change different parameters and get the resulting graph. What happens if you change population, transport costs, or income on the graph below?

<chart name="transport-costs" width="80%"></chat>

<chart name="income" width="80%"></chat>

<details>
  <summary>Why does this happen?</summary>
    
  ### Population
  
  As demand for housing increases in cities, more opportunities become profitable for developers. This causes land values to increase. In the outskirts of the city, this means that more land will outbid the value of farmland. In the centre, it means that some buildings are no longer profitable enough for the land they sit on, so taller buildings are needed for the land to be profitable (an incentive that would be higher with land value taxes, but more on that in my article about housing prices). 
  
  - Proof
  
  ### Transport costs
  
  As transport costs decrease, it becomes cheaper for people in the outskirts to travel to the centre. This means that that land becomes more valuable and thus more land will outbid the value farmland. Since population is held constant, people will over time move from the centre to fill the empty spots in outskirts. 
  
  - Proof
  
  ### Income
  
  As people get higher income, they tend to demand more housing. When everyone wants bigger living space and with less people, more space is needed to accommodate this. Think how we went from living 5-10 people in one apartment to many living in studios today. 
  
  - Proof

## The mold behind urban sprawl

So how do we identify the mold from the puberty and medication side effects? Turns out, that we have been quite good at identifying these molds. We don't always have exactly the right tool to get completely rid of it, but the first step is knowing the root cause. A mold is a mold if it's a market failure. Through development of economic theory, we can easily identify a market failure. If the market failure happens to also cause outwards expansion of cities, we get urban sprawl. 

<details>
  <summary>Mold 1: Negative externalities of driving</summary>
  
  Negative externalities of driving is a mold, because an externality is a market failure that if left unsolved, naturally creates a behaviour that leads to more driving than society is willing to pay for. This happens because every kilometer driven causes costs on society that is not paid by drivers themselves. These costs are most often cited as congestion, traffic accident risk, air pollution, noise pollution, climate change contribution, and road damage. 
  
  The best way to get rid of the mold is by making the cost that drivers pay for driving equal to the cost of driving itself (the cost of gas, time, car maintenance and depreciation) + the cost that each kilometer imposes on society. In places where driver do not pay both these costs, the transport costs are lower than optimal causing a spiral of excessive commuting and excessive development on edge of the cities. So while this is often considered a transport policy, it is also a spatial policy.
  
  What societies have done so far is to do a mix of medication and using inefficient or insufficient amounts of antimold. Denmark, a country known for its high taxes on cars generally has an acceptable amount of antimold, but it is not the most effective one. According to the Danish Economic Advisory Board, the registration tax on cars and the circulation should be abolished, the tax on gas should be reduced, and instead, the country should focus on a time- and place-varying kilometer charge, which would cost more during peak-hour traffic and in cities. In this way, the costs that the driver pays for driving would best mimic the actual full costs of their driving. We could spend less antimold and completely get rid of the symptoms of excessive driving causing urban sprawl.
  
  Why are other policies inefficient? A balance exists of what society is willing to pay for driving; a balance between the benefits of driving and the costs of driving. With driving it's not so simple as just limiting the total number of cars. It is true that less cars mean less kilometers, but people who then have to opt out of using a car get deprived of the benefits of driving, while people who get a car have no incentive to reduce the amount of kilometers driven in them. It is also not as simple as just limiting the total number of kilometers driven, because not all kilometers are equally costly to society. A kilometer driven in a small car with high efficiency on the country side outside peak hour costs society a tiny fraction of a kilometer driven in a truck in the city during peak-hour. By law of economics we get the most with the least when we put a tax equal to the cost of each kilometer. The better we get at doing that, the more we get with less. 
  
  Why haven't we done this? Actually Singapore will launch this in 2023, and a lot of governments have interest in it. The drawbacks are worries of privacy and cost of the system, but the cost of the system is ever decreasing, and cybersecurity is a growing field.

<details>
  <summary>Mold 2: Economic rent</summary>
  
  Economic rent is the income that landowners can earn from owning land less the income earned from developing or improving land. It is a mold because it creates a situation where landowners can earn income without contributing to productivity or economic growth, which is seen as a market failure because it allows for wealth accumulation without corresponding productive effort, and can lead to speculative bubbles, inefficiencies, and inequalities in a market economy. The rental value of land emerges not from landlords’ individual efforts but from societal developments and community endeavors.
  
  Economic rent contributes to urban sprawl by encouraging speculative land holding; when landowners can hold onto parcels of land in urban and suburban areas without using them to their full potential, the city loses out on potential development. This means that desired space is hoarded, while nudging newer developments further outwards, which we then call urban sprawl. 
  
  A land value tax would completely mitigate the economic rent associated with land. Such a tax would ideally be set equal to the full rental value of the land, effectively eliminating all economic rent for the community, and reducing the incentive for speculative land holding to zero. In practise, there can be a small margin of error in land value assessment, so putting it a little lower than 100% is better to avoid discouraging investment in land altogether. 
  
  Why haven’t we done this? Many places have small versions of this. Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Russia, Singapore, and Taiwan currently have land values taxes, while it has been applied in a smaller extent in Mexico, Australia and the United States.

<details>
  <summary>Mold 3: Undervalued positive externalities from open space and nature</summary>
  
  Often, open space and nature does not have a value that exists in markets. This is because a lot of the benefits we gain from it, we do not pay for. If we paid for these benefits, these places would have a value which would then participate in a market, and only if other purposes exceed that value, would we build on it. 
    
  The fact that open space and nature is not valued in the price of land, means that land has a discount on some urban fringes, which makes us more likely to encroach on that land. 
    
  We should get better at determining the value of nature, biodiversity, and open space. There comes a point where the value of land is so high, that it is higher than the value we assign to this nature. When we can determine better this value, we can better create the right permissions and allow a good balance between preserving nature and house prices.

  <summary>Mold 4: Natural monopoly and network externalities of public transit</summary>

  Public transport suffers from being a natural monopoly with very high fixed costs and almost non-existent marginal costs. This means that charging marginal cost pricing is often not enough to pay for the system. On top of this, public transport has network externalities, the bigger the public transport network is, the more useful each line is. 
  
  Subsidies of public transport is not always necessary. Tokyo's public transit is able to run on a profit, while still being very accessible. In general, it is not advised for governments to subsidise the operations costs of public transport, but they should absolutely fund the expansion of the network. 
  
  The demand of public transport is distorted due to low costs of driving cars. If drivers had to pay congestion pricing, there would be a higher demand for public transport. Only after then can proper public transport investment analysis be made.

## The strong medication behind urban sprawl

<details>
  <summary>Pill 1: Height related regulations</summary>

  Policies that restrict the upwards expansion of buildings is a limit on housing supply. These can both be via **historic building preservation** (which prevents old buildings from being demolished) or via specific **restrictions on height of new buildings** sometimes applied as floor-area-ratio restrictions. In urban areas, it is mostly done for airport routes, earthquake safety or to protect the view for certain landmarks or a historic skyline. In suburban areas the restrictions can be much lower and is often done to avoid casting shadows on neighbours. Building heights do create negative externalities, but height restrictions are a strong medication, while the mold causing the headache lives on. 
  
  The limit on housing supply has consequences for house prices, but it also means that this supply has to be supplied elsewhere, which means that new development has to happen elsewhere than in height restricted areas - including the urban fringe. 
  
  Height related restrictions should be limited as much as possible and cities should analyse whether historic skylines are worth the high cost. An alternative solution than height restrictions would be to use GIS tools to estimate the reductions in land values for new taller projects and making developers pay these value reductions to internalise the negative externalities of building heights. With land value taxes equalling economic rent, homeowners would always be compensated through lower land taxes if their neighbours were to build an extra floor. 
  
  Not much research has been done for alternative solutions, but the discussion about height restrictions is a hot topic in many cities. Some cities compromise by creating dedicated areas where taller buildings are allowed, but the more we confine development upwards, the more will be developed outwards. We need more research on how height relates to property values and what tools can be used to internalise the externalities.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Pill 2: Space related regulations</summary>

  Policies that regulates a minimum amount of living space either in the form of minimum apartment space or minimum lot sizes are space related regulations. Both are meant to ensure a certain standard of living, while minimum lot size policies also attempts to maintain a certain characteristic of a neighbourhood. 
  
  Both policies contribute to urban sprawl by using up more space than the market would have created. If everyone has a bigger garden, every home will be further apart. And if two apartments get merged to one, that is one less household able to live in the centre. 
  
  These policies limit the housing supply while forcing people to pay more for land, even if some would have been happy with less space if it meant paying less. 
  
  Cities should focus on alternative ways to maintain character in a neighbourhood if that is deemed important. Having the same size houses and lots does not necessarily matter as much as other design characteristics. 
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Pill 3: Parking related regulations</summary>

  Many cities around the world encourage parking by either providing too much of it, enforcing minimum parking requirements on new buildings or by making it too cheap to use. When parking is oversupplied, it means we are using precious land for comparatively inefficient uses. 
  
  The more space is allocated for parking, the less space can necessarily be dedicated to other purposes like housing. This housing then has to be built elsewhere pushing people out.  
  
  Cities would naturally have less space dedicated to parking if cities dedicated less space for parking as they develop. 
  
  Cities should remove minimum parking laws, apply parking pricing that ensures the optimal occupancy rate by the hour, and compare revenues of these parking lots with the opportunity costs to adjust the number of parking spots. 
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Pill 4: Road finance</summary>

  Governments and cities provide citizens with roads as a public service. When this road space is not paid for, we are subsidising the use of the roads. This means that any demand for the use of the roads is exaggerated.
  
  The more space is allocated to roads, the less space is allocated to buildings and the more spread out cities get. 
  
  Cities should start charging drivers congestion pricing and compare the revenues of each lane with the opportunity cost of what that lane could have been in stead and adjust the number of lanes and roads based on whether the roads pay for themselves. 
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Pill 5: Commuting subsidies and parking permits</summary>

  Many governments provide tax benefits for commuting and many companies provide compensation for commuting or parking. This is usually done to soften the burden of long commutes and to attract businesses who will have access to a larger labour market.
  
  As we have seen from the transport graph, lowering transport costs makes cities sprawl more (and in the process ends up increasing commuting anyways). 
  
  Cities should stop subsidising commuting. The benefits could have been achieved with far less distortions by for example lowering certain taxes. This is again an example of giving people vouchers instead of money. If cities want to attract businesses, they should invest in R&D, fund universities, and charge less distortionary taxes on consumers, not subsidise consumption.  
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Pill 6: Unbalanced finance of infrastructure</summary>

  Cities have to pay for a lot of infrastructure, but these cost are not evenly distributed across the city. Certain areas cost far more for cities to maintain and build than others compared to how much taxes these areas generate. The fewer people each road, power line, sewers, and other public services service per square meter, the more costly it is. The suburbs usually cost much more per capita to service than urban cores. This is due to economies of scale. 
  
  This means that the suburbs are usually far more costly to maintain than urban cores. Since these costs are usually not reflected in the taxes people pay, suburban dwellers get a disproportionate amount of discount for their public services. This incentivises suburban living causing urban sprawl.
  
  Impact fees have been used to make sure that new development is mostly paid by the new residents of that area. Land value taxes should also make the distribution of costs more fair since an apartment tower would share the costs of land value taxes, which doesn’t increase with the size of the building. 
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Pill 7: Mortgage subsidies</summary>

  Governments have attempted to relieve the pressure of high house prices for homeowners by subsidising mortgages. This creates an incentive to homeownership. 
  
  Other than causing prices to increase, it also increases the chance that people will buy a house rather than rent an apartment. This shift towards homeownership causes a bias towards suburban living, creating higher demand for new suburban development causing urban sprawl 
  
  Subsidies should have never existed. Subsidies are for positive externalities, not consumption goods that people need. It does not solve the problem at all to have subsidies.
