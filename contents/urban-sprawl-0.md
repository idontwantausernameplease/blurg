Outwards spatial growth of cities is a natural occurrence happening from population increases. Still, sometimes this expansion is exaggerated due to market failures or government failures and then we get urban sprawl. In this article, I explain when exactly spatial growth is excessive and I identify, which problems do and don't cause this excess.

## The difference between urban sprawl and spatial growth
When cities grow, they do so both outwards and upwards. There is a slight trade-off between the two: Limits to outwards expansion creates more pressure for upwards expansion and vice versa. Both urban sprawl and spatial growth refers to outwards expansion. When it comes to urban sprawl, I prefer using Brueckner's (2000) definition, which is "*excessive* spatial growth" with emphasis on *excessive*. This definition implies that:
- Urban sprawl is undesirable
- Spatial growth/outwards expansion is not necessarily undesirable

This distinction is important, because spatial growth is a natural part of human progress. It happens for instance when:
- Populations increase
- Incomes increase

When populations increase, demand for housing increases, and since it is not efficient to accomodate these people solely through upwards expansion, agricultural land gets outbidded for urban development due to the outwards pressure. Increasing income increases demand for more space and has similar effects. Spatial growth from increase in population or income is by Brueckner **not** enough to classify the expansion as urban sprawl.

PS. If you worry that this eventually will be the end of the world, according to Hans Rosling, [population growth will eventually reach zero](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_global_population_growth_box_by_box?language=en) and economically, there will always be an equilibrium balance between agricultural land and urban land. When it comes to natural space, there is a field of environmental economists and natural resource economists who have a lot of great ideas for that, that I will touch a bit upon later. 

Some factors drive urban growth into either upward or outward:
- Outward: Improvements in transport technology
- Upward: Improvements in construction technology
- Outward: Increased preferences for proximity to nature and more space 
- Upward: Increased preferences for proximity to shops, museums and other urban amenities

Spatial growth from improvements in transport technology or increased preferences for proximity to nature or more space is by Bruckner **not** enough to classify expansion as urban sprawl. 

So when is spatial growth considered urban sprawl? 
The part of spatial growth that can be considered urban sprawl comes from the economic problems that lead to excessive outwards expansion. I explain the importance of how we define the problem in the next section. 

## Urban sprawl is the symptom, not the disease
Let's say you are born with a disease with certain symptoms. It is not deadly, but it keeps you from living your full potential. If you are lucky, there is a cure, which will end the disease without side effects. Alternatively, you can treat the symptoms using a treatment that may have side effects and might not completely resolve all the symptoms. 
Cures might sometimes involve a bigger investment, but will be more beneficial in the long run through creating less side effects. If you have gotten used to certain treatments, your body might also need time to adapt to the cure. 

Similarly, market failures inately exist everywhere in the world, they do not shut down all economies, but they keep them from reaching their potential. Some market failures have first-best policies, which solve the market failure without unintended unpredictable consequences, and some have second-best policies, which produce unintended unpredictable consequences that may need new policies and may not fully solve the market failure.
First-best policies are sometimes more costly, but in the long run they will be more beneficial because they create less consequences to develop policy for. As you develop more policies to deal with all these consequences, it becomes more difficult to switch to a better policy as society adapts to the other policies. 

However, as society grows, first-best policies become technologically more feasible. This analogy has two main implications: Firstly, it calls for a focus shift toward defining problems based on the root cause rather than the consequence. Secondly, it calls for a focus shift toward getting better at using first-best policy when possible.

Getting back to urban sprawl, by Brueckner (2000), urban sprawl is a *consequence* of a list of market and government failures. Defining urban sprawl as the problem is like choosing to focus on the symptoms rather than the disease. Doing so, also creates a confusing landscape in terms of figuring out when urban sprawl is solved.
