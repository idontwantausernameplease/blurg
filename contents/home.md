# Our cities are a bit like our bodies

- Their complexity makes it difficult to gain a full understanding of them
- We continuously get better at improving their function
- Medication tends to have side effects, and removing root causes tends to not

We often look at diseases in terms of finding the right medication rather than preventing them from happening. Our cities have a lot of headaches, and we tend to prescribe them costly and side-effect-heavy pills despite knowing the mold that causes the headaches. Why do we do this? Because unlike with our bodies, the solution to the diseases that our cities get needs public appeal. This is my attempt to appeal to the public to understand why the solutions to our problems are not always the most sexy ones. 

A subsidy for housing sounds a lot better than a land value tax and a subsidy for renewable energy consumption sounds a lot better than a tax on fossil fuels. But urban planners and urban economists understand that this is not how it works. In order to create change, we need to bridge this knowledge gap, and it helps a lot if the public understands it as well. 

In medicine, we have gone from cutting off legs to antibiotics and from dying from viruses to being vaccinated. Improvement is when we have less disease and fewer side effects. Improvement in urban policy is the same. Finding policies that create the least side effects while reducing problems the most.

I am a researcher of spatial & transport economics. In this collaborative series, I develop a systematic guide on how to solve the biggest challenges cities face.
