# Why first best?

First best refers to the theoretically best possible policy option to solve a market failure. One that involves no distortion and the highest welfare gain. 

Our cities are a complicated mess of failed policies and market failures that have not been solved efficiently.Â 
I am a researcher of spatial & transport economics. In this collaborative series, I develop a systematic guide on how to solve the biggest challenges cities face.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
  printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
  Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
