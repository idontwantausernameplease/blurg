# How our cities are a bit like our bodies

Much like our bodies, cities are complex organisms; vibrant but not immune to disease. The trick, though, is to not just reach for the nearest “pill” to quell the symptoms, which often carries side effects, but to dissect the problems methodically, identifying and addressing the very mold that causes them. 

In the world of medicine as in urban policy, there is a tendency to reach for "medicines" — immediate solutions to pressing issues. However, much like an adept physician, we prefer going from administering medicine to identifying the molds or the root causes, fostering a prevention-first approach. Because, when we remove the mold, we not only alleviate the symptoms but we sidestep potential side effects that often accompany quick fixes. 

The difference between the two worlds is that in medicine, it can be difficult to discover the mold, but it is easy for the public to tell the difference between medicine and prevention, but in urban economics, we know the mold, but it is hard for the public to tell the difference between mold and medicine. A subsidy for renewable energy sounds a lot better than a tax on fossil fuels, but an environmental economist might tell you otherwise. 

I need your help. I believe in democracy, so starting this conversation is essential in bridging this knowledge gap. This also means that I have to strike the balance between conveying scientific information while making it accessible. In order to avoid spreading misinformation or exaggerated confidence, I want you to help me by holding me accountable whenever you see something wrong or misleading, so we can discuss it together. You can do this by clicking the "edit page" button in the top. I aim to add FAQ's as a separate page or in line of the text, when applicable.

  <summary>But isn't economics all about benefitting corporations and making the rich richer?</summary>
  Capitalism and economics are not the same thing. Economics is about balance. About getting the most out of the least in a world with scarce resources such as land. Ideally, the balance would just be determined by the supply and demand of land, and you would automatically land on that spot through Adam Smith's “invisible hand”, but we discovered about 100 years ago, that market failures exist, and without solving these, we end up worse off.

I am a researcher of spatial & transport economics. In this collaborative series, I develop a systematic guide on how to solve the biggest challenges cities face.
