Residential moving costs make people make fewer moves towards closer distances - Congestion and residential moving behaviour (Jos van Ommeren, 2008)


Another way to identify the effect of moving costs on the commute is by focusing on the effect of rent control on the length of the commute (Benito and Oswald, 1999; Krol and Svorny, 2005; Svarer et al., 2005; Art√≠s et al., 2000). Here, the general idea is that rent control generally induces lock-in effects due to the loss in rent subsidy that the household would experience if it were to move out of rent-controlled apartments (e.g., Arnott, 2003). Furthermore, rent control may induce other implicit moving costs, as renters who aim to move within the rent-controlled sector are constrained in their choices and obtain accommodation usually through queuing systems or via lottery. Benito and Oswald (1999) report that renters in the controlled rental market have a commute that is about 15% longer than the commutes of those who occupy a non-rent-controlled accommodation. - (jos van ommeren 2008)
