# Participate

I am obsessed with democracy. And apart from believing in the one person one vote over one dollar one vote system, I believe that healthy democracies exist with informed voters. You cannot have informed voters without a public discourse and deep discussions. Making big decisions for society is important, and making the right decision is not possible without any questioning. 

In order to continously improve our knowledge on this topic and to have a space to discuss these topics, I have created a discord server. 

You can find it it [here](https://discord.gg/RrTa9qSE).
