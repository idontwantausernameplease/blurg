# Why first best?

First best refers to the theoretically best possible policy option to solve a market failure. One that involves no distortion and the highest welfare gain. 

Our cities are a complicated mess of failed policies and market failures that have not been solved efficiently.Â 
I am a researcher of spatial & transport economics. In this collaborative series, I develop a systematic guide on how to solve the biggest challenges cities face.
