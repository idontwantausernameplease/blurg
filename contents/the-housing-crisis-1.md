# Getting the housing market right: How to combat excessive housing costs

A common recent approach (see, for example, Ihlanfeldt 2007) is to measure the intensity of land-use restrictions using data from a survey of local governments. The survey indicates how many types of restrictions each government has in place (whether it has a UGB, levies impact fees, and so on), and the intensity measure is a simple count of the number of restrictions. This count measure is then used as an explanatory variable in a regression in which the dependent variable is a house price measure. The regression includes a variety of other control variables. The results from this type of study typically show the expected effect: house prices in a locality rise with an increase in the number of land restrictions in place.

Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) measured the gap between the price per square foot of housing and construction cost per square foot in different communities. Noting that the two values should be equal in a competitive market, they argue that a large gap indicates the presence of government regulations that inhibit housing supply. - as seen in bruckner 2011.

From Brueckner (2011):
  There  is  a  large  empirical  literature  exploring  the  effect  of  land-use  controls  on  housing  prices.  With  the  model  showing  that  UGBs,  building-height restrictions, other density restrictions, and impact fees all raise the price p per unit of housing, the expected effect is in a positive direction. A common recent approach (see, for example, Ihlanfeldt 2007)  is  to  measure  the  intensity  of  land-use  restrictions  using  data  from  a  survey  of  local  governments.  The  survey  indicates  how  many  types  of  restrictions  each  government  has  in  place  (whether  it  has  a  UGB,  levies  impact  fees,  and  so  on),  and  the  intensity  measure  is  a  simple count of the number of restrictions. This count measure is then used as an explanatory variable in a regression in which the dependent variable is a house price measure. The regression includes a variety of other  control  variables.  The  results  from  this  type  of  study  typically  show the expected effect: house prices in a locality rise with an increase in the number of land restrictions in place.   Taking  a  different  approach  to  exploring  the  effects  of  regulation,  Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) measured the gap between the price per  square  foot  of  housing  and  construction  cost  per  square  foot  in  different communities. Noting that the two values should be equal in a competitive market, they argue that a large gap indicates the presence of government regulations that inhibit housing supply.

Mortgage subsidies
Based on the provided research results, there is evidence that mortgage subsidies may make housing less affordable. Hendershortt and Shilling (1989) suggest that lower mortgage rates, which are often subsidized, can raise homeownership and the quantity of housing demanded by homeowners, but can also raise interest rates generally, partially offsetting the ownership subsidy [36]. Heylen (2013) found that mortgage tax relief can enhance housing demand, which might increase prices to a large extent when price elasticity of housing demand is low, and that about 75% of the subsidy is reflected in house prices [37]. Krolage and Krolage (2022) suggest that most empirical evidence indicates that such tax subsidies do not increase the homeownership rate and are passed-through into property prices [38].

Land speculation:
Supply-Side Speculation in the Housing Market. The University of Chicago Press Journals, 131(5), 1987-2023. https://doi.org/10.1086/693008  Based on the provided research results, there is evidence that land speculation may make housing less affordable. Nathanson and Zwick (2018) suggest that speculation in the land market can intensify the speculation that causes booms and busts in house prices, challenging the standard intuition that in cities where construction is easier, house price booms are smaller [39]. This can make housing less affordable for potential buyers. Additionally, Zwick (2017) argues that supply-side speculation in the housing market can lead to a reduction in the supply of housing, which can drive up prices and make housing less affordable [40].
