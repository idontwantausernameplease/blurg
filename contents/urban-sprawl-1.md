We talked about the importance of framing the problem not as urban sprawl but as the market and government failures that separates urban sprawl from mere outwards expansion or spatial growth. Framing the problem as sprawl and ignoring the root causes of it will further complicatet he web of inefficient policies.

The market and government failures leading to urban sprawl are:



### Excessive car use
Excessive car use is a consequence of a list of market and government failures. I list it as a consequence, because there will be a [whole section](/?p=excessive-driving-1) devoted to talking about the root causes of excessive car use. 

Car use has always had a dual relationship with outwards expansion of cities; as people can drive more (due to lower transport costs and higher income), they can live further away, and as people live further away, other modes of transport becomes less viable. If this car use is excessive, it will add more demand for outwards expansion that can be considered urban sprawl. 

The car use is excessive as long as infrastructure for car use (driving and parking) is provided without users paying for it and as long as there are uninternalised externalities of driving. So removing the "excessive" from "excessive car use" means dealing with each market and government failure individually and applying solutions as close to first best policy as possible.

### Land speculation
Land speculation is a financial activity that involves purchasing land or real estate with the hope that it will increase in value. As long as land is scarce and populations are rising, land value is expected to increase higher than inflation, which makes it a bubble very unlikely to burst. This makes land a very attractive investment increasing the demand for investing in it.

Since it is such a good investment, land speculation makes it possible to earn from simply holding on to land, whether there is a building on it or not. This gives a land owner little incentive to actually create an improvement on the land. Even if there is an improvement on the land, and it is rented out, they have little incentive to improve it further. Simply put, the possibility of land speculation in the context of urban sprawl lowers vacancy rates in housing, decreases the rate of construction, and discourages infill development. All of these add pressure to outwards expansion.

### Zoning and land use regulations
Local and national governments have many rules on what can be built where and how. These include:
- The use of the land (residential, commercial...)
- The form of the property
- Minimum parking requirements
- The internal structure of the property
- Other

[Go to solution](/?p=urban-sprawl-2#zoning-and-land-use-regulations)
#### The use of the land
Regulating the use of land is done to protect and stabilise the value of land. A factory being built next to a residential area would have consequences for the land values as well as increased external costs coming from the factory through higher exposure to air, noise, and ground pollution. Without compensation for reduced land values and without internalisation of external costs, factories or other uses with nuisance would not be disincentivised to locate in suboptimal areas and we would get suboptimal land use. On the contrary, zoning too strictly can also result in inefficient outcomes since businesses and residences will not always be in their optimal locations. Strict zoning can mean that you cannot have a shop in your house or a restaurant across the street. The effect of this specific part of zoning on urban sprawl is actually not so clear, but too much separation of zones is likely making people more car dependent since the average distance to a destination is higher the more separated uses are, and car dependency is a function of proximity.  

[Go to solution](/?p=urban-sprawl-2#the-use-of-the-land)
#### The form of the property
The zoning regulations of the use of land usually also specifies the form of a building. This includes the type of building (single-family detached housing, duplexes, rowhouses etc.), height restrictions, minimum lot size restrictions, and building setbacks/frontage/garden space. All of these have the purpose to protect land values. A tall building may cast a shadow on a lot of buildings, utilities may need to be able to reach buildings, buildings with high variation in setbacks may provide an unaesthetic lack of uniformity, and small irregular lots can create issues with property rights. However, all these restrictions either increase the average dwelling size or decrease the amount of dwellings per unit of land - both of which adds pressure to outward expansion that can be considered urban sprawl.

#### Minimum parking requirements
To alleviate the pressure of on-street parking demand, some cities have chosen to mandate minimum parking requirements in certain locations. This means that dependent on the assumed parking demand of the building, the government will set a minimum amount of parking spots required for development. This is often done because the buildings otherwise take advantage of the free parking provided by the street, which creates a shortage of parking spots unless they are priced. Similar to building setbacks, this lowers the amount of dwellings per unit of land and means less space for real estate than optimal resulting in outwards expansion pressure that we can call urban sprawl.

#### The internal structure of the property
Sometimes governments have laws regarding the internal structure of the building. Relevant to urban sprawl is regulations on the minimum room size, the minimum dwelling size, and the minimum amount of rooms per resident. Some of these are done for safety purposes, and others are done to raise the minimum standard of living. Some have complained that "greedy developers" have built too small, which have resulted in increasing the minimum dwelling size required. Unfortunately some people might have been willing to live in that space for the lower price it would have. All of these laws increase the average dwelling size and thus contributes to pressure for outwards expansion leading to more urban sprawl.

#### Other
Governments also regulate the design of buildings, sets standards for quality control, and sets standards for sustainability. While these may be costly additions for developers and there might be first best solutions to some of them, they also are not expected to have important implications for urban sprawl. 

### Historic building preservation
Historic building preservation is done because old city centres have a historic amenity (koster article). The age of the buildings are considered to be valued by the citizens. It is not exactly clear how much of this value is derived from the age of the building itself or it's historic properties and how much is from specific design choices that could be copied today, but historic areas do have value. However, preserving old buildings also functions as a height restriction since buildings cannot be rebuilt at higher densities to deal with changing demands. This limits both the average dwelling size and the amount of dwellings per land resulting in urban sprawl.

### Mortgage subsidies
Mortgage subsidies are often a tool used to help people afford housing in a time of difficulty in doing so. Instead of focusing on why that doesn't work, I want to put focus on how it affects urban sprawl. Since most loans in housing are made for single-family detached housing, a housing mortgage subsidy favors purchases of single-family detached houses more than apartments. This means that a demand is induced for single-family detached housing. A type of housing taking more space. At the same time it gives homebuyers more purchasing power to buy bigger homes with larger lots resulting in taking even more space. Both of these create pressure for outwards expansion and thus result in urban sprawl.

### Unbalanced infrastructure finance
We all pay taxes in the location we live in. These taxes are fairly equal across space. However the costs of the public infrastructure provided is very unequal per citizen across space. In the suburbs, the costs of providing infrastructure is a lot more costly per person than in more urban areas. This is because of economies of scale and cost sharing. This means that suburban dwellers get a big tax discount for the amount public infrastructure needed to sustain them, which induces an inefficient shift towards suburban living. Since suburban living takes more space per person, this creates an outwards expansion pressure that we can call urban sprawl.

### Open space and nature externalities
Nature and open space around cities provide citizens with positive amenities. People get joy out of having access to nature. Building on nature would thus cause some reductions in land values. However, being too strict on where to build can have serious impacts on housing affordability. Ignoring open space and nature externalities would lead to development patterns towards outwards expansion that we can call urban sprawl.

## Other critiques of urbanÂ sprawl
While urban sprawl is mostly a consequence of distortions (an umbrella term for government and market failures), urban sprawl also contributes to some consequences.

Brueckner & Helsley (2011) have found a connection between urban sprawl and the neglect of central city development causing inner city decay and blight. The mechanism is, that if you can develop on the fringe, there is less incentive to develop and maintain the downtown. Bradford & Kelejian (1973) has argued that the opposite is true: blight can cause urban sprawl. Brueckner (2011) argues that both likely have an element of truth.

Other critics of urban sprawl such as Burchfield et al. (2006) say that it causes scattered development leaving patches of land within the city undeveloped, which leaves wasted infrastructure and further excessive travel distances. There may be benefits of these patches in terms of leaving space for denser developments later on, but these patterns still involve some problems.

Some critics say that lower urban density areas have fewer cases of social interaction, which can cause mental and social problems, but Brueckner & Largey (2008) found that the opposite is the case. The lower the urban density, the more social interaction.

Some researchers have shown correlations between obesity and urban sprawl. However, Eid et al. (2008) find that the more likely explanation is that obese people are more likely to live in the suburbs; he found that people who move to suburbs or inner cities do not change their weight.

It is also often argued that we have to be careful not to take too much farmland away, but this argument is misguided. The value of farmland is fully reflected in the price developers pay for the land. If developers decide to buy farmland, it means that whatever use the developers have for the land is worth more than whatever use the farmers had for the land. If farmland became truly scarce and in need of preservation, its selling price would be high, making the land resistant to urban encroachment.

I have argued that urban sprawl is not only a result of artificially high transport demand (via low transport prices), but it also exacerbates the artificially high transport demand (via creating living spaces that encourage car use). The mechanism is that transport prices influence how many people use a car and how much they use them. This in turn makes people demand more car infrastructure, less infrastructure for other modes, and more low-density (sparse) housing. If the prices then are to increase, the infrastructure and the low-density developments will still exist and may never change or take decades to change. Urban sprawl thus makes transport problems very long-run problems, and the sooner it can be dealt with, the less it will burden us over time.

Regardless of the validity of these extra problems of urban sprawl, they do not pose a reason to limit spatial growth, but rather increase the urgency of solving the root causes. The root causes themselves create inefficiencies apart from just contributing to urban sprawl.

## Conclusions
Urban sprawl itself is not a problem, it's a consequence of a set of market and government failures that either produce the problem or try to combat it inefficiently. The most efficient way to solve it would be to look to the root of the problems by tackling the market failures and the policies that cause them.

I argue that the extra problems of urban sprawl pose an urgency to solve the root causes of urban sprawl rather than creating reasons to limit urban sprawl through new policies.
