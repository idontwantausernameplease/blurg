## The root causes
Use Puga & Duranton (2015) and Brueckner (2011)
### Excessive car use
Glaeser & Kahn (2004)
My own paper (2022)
### Zoning and land-use regulations
A common recent approach (see, for example, Ihlanfeldt 2007) is to measure the intensity of land-use restrictions using data from a survey of local governments. The survey indicates how many types of restrictions each government has in place (whether it has a UGB, levies impact fees, and so on), and the intensity measure is a simple count of the number of restrictions. This count measure is then used as an explanatory variable in a regression in which the dependent variable is a house price measure. The regression includes a variety of other control variables. The results from this type of study typically show the expected effect: house prices in a locality rise with an increase in the number of land restrictions in place.

Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) measured the gap between the price per square foot of housing and construction cost per square foot in different communities. Noting that the two values should be equal in a competitive market, they argue that a large gap indicates the presence of government regulations that inhibit housing supply. - as seen in bruckner 2011. 

### Height restrictions

### Historic building protection
### Spatially equal payment of public infrastructure (streets, sewers, parks, and schools, etc) despite spatially unequal costs
### Mortgage subsidies
### Open space amenities from farmland
### Too little emphasis on land value taxes as a means of government revenue as opposed to other taxes
### Land value speculations
game of rent
### Assigning no value to open space or nature

## The insufficient remedy

### Urban growth boundary
Urban growth boundaries are a tool specifically used to limit spatial growth. The problem with urban growth boundaries is that there is no real way of determining where the boundaries optimally should be. Even if there was a way, those optimal boundaries would change over time, because a long list of dynamic parameters affects where the boundaries should be (Brueckner, 2000). This is another reason to solve the root causes; they tend to be much easier to calculate an optimal solution for. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721006256?casa_token=20oYyUq-KBEAAAAA:mLmGGlUMuyL7TXt-ZejT1FG2cMTfGDf316UuHSHKZ8YQluJCRU1A3qhPt_Ip3I51a5sMXVtdYA

This also means that it is difficult to compare the degree of urban sprawl between countries and maybe even regions. Because these may have different levels of population growth, income growth, preferences for suburbs, and transport costs. You can have a very spread out city with all market failures accounted for, but they may be spread out for legimitate reasons.Â
